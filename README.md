# langchain-app-gradio
Currently, in demo, this will serve as the project that I thought of doing during the summer vacation

## Possible Application 
Chainlit man. It's everything I need. One of the things will be hosted at Huggingface spaes, other will be at Chainlit deployment(maybe Fly.io, Google App Engine or something like that.)
